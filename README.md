Hallo Everyone !

This app for inputing the data, (CREATE, READ, UPADATE and DELETE).

I built this app with Angular 15 , angular material and JSON server.
I used HTTP Method GET,POST and PATCH.

 *You have to run the server first for app working well* :
-> install JSON first if you dont have, sudo npm install -g json-server
-> npm run json-server


YOU CAN ACCESS THE APP with the link below :

Thank You.
